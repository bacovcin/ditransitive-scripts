Stan file nomenclature
full all variables
order order variable fixed by ration of AD/DA order
noi subset of order without interaction terms
same subset of noi with variable held constant between functions
b = To slope (act means that AD/DA have the same slope vs. pas, to means all have the same slope, ad means ad/pas have the same slope vs. da)
a = Acc reanalysis slope

g is a subset of b or a in which the io interaction is also identical as well as the slope
